# Phase 2 — Multi-source evidence ontology

## Goal

Extend Pōneke Movement Watch from a single-source anomaly feed into a small,
working multi-source evidence graph that follows the supplied ontology:
Observation → Entity Resolution → Evidence → Hypothesis → Human Decision →
Confirmed Fact.

## Status

- [completed] Parse the ontology brief, audit the current repository, and verify candidate public sources.
- [completed] Select the smallest high-value source set and define provenance, freshness, reliability, and entity-resolution contracts.
- [completed] Add failing contract tests for the ontology and contradictory-evidence behavior.
- [completed] Implement source normalization, entity resolution, evidence/hypothesis outputs, and backward-compatible COP feeds.
- [completed] Extend the operator UI to distinguish observation, inference, decision, and confirmed fact.
- [completed] Run replay, regression, build, and visual checks; update documentation and downloadable source archive.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every claim has a typed epistemic state: `observation`, `inference`, `decision`, or `confirmed_fact`.
- Observations carry source, observed/published times, freshness, location/entity links, quality, and attribution.
- Supporting, contradicting, neutral, and missing evidence remain visible; absence of a closure is not treated as proof of no disruption.
- Hypotheses are ranked transparently without presenting an uncalibrated score as probability.
- Human confirmation is represented as a new fact and never synthesized by the model.
- The existing movement GeoJSON remains consumable while new ontology/evidence feeds compose into the shared COP.
- Only verified public sources are implemented; no personal 111-call data, private traffic provider, or unverified social content is fabricated.
- Existing WCC `TICKET_DETAIL` rows and NZTA TMS rows are accepted in the supplied format; requester names are dropped at the ingestion boundary.

## Assumptions and exclusions

- The user's new request authorizes adding data sources and supersedes the prior single-source restriction.
- Prefer sources already catalogued by `wcc-emergency-gis-data`, then official NZ/Wellington public endpoints.
- This remains a prototype/replay, not an operational emergency system or automated dispatch tool.
- No causal declaration, calibrated incident probability, route optimisation, public messaging, or autonomous response in this phase.

## Errors encountered

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|---|---:|---|
| Git Bash treated a `C:` archive path as a remote tar target | 1 | Re-ran the official packaging script with an MSYS `/c/...` path. |
